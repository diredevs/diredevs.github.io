That show&#39;s called a pilot. Then they show that show to the people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they&#39;re going to make more shows. Some pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don&#39;t, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.</p><p>You think water moves fast? You should see ice. It moves like it has a mind. Like it knows it killed the world once and got a taste for murder. After the avalanche, it took us a week to climb out. Now, I don&#39;t know exactly when we turned on each other, but I know that seven of us survived the slide... and only five made it out. Now we took an oath, that I&#39;m breaking now. We said we&#39;d say it was the snow that killed the other two, but it wasn&#39;t. Nature is lethal but it doesn&#39;t hold a candle to man.</p><p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime.

Like they&#39;re actually proud of that shit.</p></div></div><footer class=footer><div class=wrap>2013 Â© Diredevs</div></footer><script src=/js/d41d.scripts.js></script></body></html>
